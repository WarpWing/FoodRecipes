# Crockpot Italian Chicken

## Items: 

- 3-4 chicken breasts
- 1 can cream of chicken soup
- 1 block of cream cheese 
- 1 packet of dry Italian dressing mix

## Instructions: 

Put it all in the crockpot and cook it on low for 8 hours (or high for 4.) If you're home and can stir it halfway, do so, but it will be fine either way. 
When it's done, shred chicken and stir it all up. (You can also chunk the chicken or leave it in breasts, but my favorite is shredded.)  Serve over rice.
